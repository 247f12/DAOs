## Community Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (D.A.O.s)

### Neighbourhood-level democracy without a central governing body

A  **D.A.O.** is a new way of organising which focuses on transparency, a bottom-up system of control, and lack of influence from central governments. Originally the term applied to online businesses where there is no boss or corporate management structure, only shareholders, each of whom have a say on how the business will operate, allocate funds for whatever the business does, and observe what the other shareholders are doing within the business.

In this case, the ‘business’ is your local area, and you, the residents, are its ‘shareholders’ by right of living there. A *D.A.O.* is not a company or government organisation: it’s a group of people who want to get directly involved in community decision-making by getting to know their neighbours face-to-face, and who want to bring their community together by directly helping those in need using the time, money, or specialised skills that each of them can afford to share.

The aim is not for anyone to unfairly benefit off of anybody else’s contribution, but to improve the local area and how well it works for everybody that lives there. Not only is it rewarding, it actively builds networks of people who will support and defend each other in future times of crisis or failure of the state to provide basic needs. On top of that, it will lead to less reliance on local councils, which are already too underfunded and overworked to provide for members of the community adequately as it is, and will only lose more resources as we enter a period of austerity for the second time in 10 years.

**The basic principles of any Community D.A.O. are:**

* Respect and support for every member of the community, particularly those most vulnerable to mistreatment by the council, police, the legal system and other governing bodies.

* Communication and bonding between residents of the same street or group of streets with a regular ‘Neighbourhood Assembly’-style meeting where each attendee can represent the interests of their household in the community decision-making process.

* If many streets or groups or streets begin to assemble in the same area, the election of removable representatives from each small group and the formation of a larger neighbourhood assembly where issues to do with the larger area are discussed.

* A process for resolving interpersonal conflicts directly without getting the authorities involved and avoiding the build-up of unaddressed problems between neighbours and fellow community members where possible.

* Decentralisation of resources, information and power from the hands of the ‘specialised’ few, to those whose lives are most affected by what decisions are made, who makes them and for what reasons.

* Over time, to move towards a model of urban development where the benefit of the current residents is held in higher regard than the corporate interests of luxury property developers and local councils that benefit from contracts aimed at higher-earning potential residents.

A group can create any number of new rules as well as these to these when forming a **D.A.O.**, it’s completely up to those who participate in it. Start a **D.A.O.** in your community now!
