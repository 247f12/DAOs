## How do I make my own site?

## Making it your own
- All the code is yours to edit however there are some key things that you may want to change first.

### Home page
- You can edit this through **index.md** in the **root** directory.

### Blog/Updates posts
- You can add blog posts by simply adding mardown files (.md) files into the **\_posts** folder.
- File names for blog posts should be date followed by the title so that they appear in the right order, eg. **2020-07-03-nameofpost.md**.
- Posts should always start with:
	
	\---

	layout: post

	title: Example Post Title

	date: 2020-07-03
